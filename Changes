Revision history for Perl extension IPC::ConcurrencyLimit

  - Skip the forking tests for WithStandby on uncommon OS.
    Specifically, CPAN testers showed failures on Solaris that I have
    no hope of debugging. It's more likely to be a bug in the tests
    than a bug in the module. Contributors welcome.
    For now, disable forking tests on non-linux, non-darwin, non-win32.
